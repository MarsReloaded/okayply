All ply-libs for C++ I saw had insane amounts of bloat or a bad design or missing simple features or insane amounts of copied data or no custom data types or everything mentioned all at once.

For this reason I wrote a small single-header ply-lib that hopefully ages a bit better.

This is an alpha. Feel free to test the code and suggest stuff that can be done better or fix bugs etc (permission granted).
