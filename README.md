All ply-libs for C++ I saw had insane amounts of bloat or a bad design or missing simple features or insane amounts of copied data (passing large vectors by value, etc.) or no custom data types or everything all at once.

For this reason I wrote a small single-header ply-lib that hopefully ages a bit better and is easy to use.

This is an alpha. Feel free to test the code and suggest stuff that can be done better or fix bugs etc (permission granted).
